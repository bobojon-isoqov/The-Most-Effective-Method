        <h2>The Problems</h2>                                   
        <section>
        <p>What is the main problem that the majority of people study English for a number of years but still they aren’t able to speak in English? Of the Indian students who approached me!</p>  
        </section>
        
        <section>
        <p>I know a lot of people who have studied English for 5 to 10 years, even 19 years but still they are not able to communicate in English! I know those who know tones of words, but still
        have the same problem! I know professors who can’t speak!</p> 
        </section>
        
        <h2>What are they are doing wrong? </h2>
        
        <h3>There are 4 Major Problems:</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Not having a specific vision! (why and how much?)</li>
        <li>Too much grammar and rules! </li>
        <li>Too many useless words!</li>
        <li>Laziness </li>
        </ol>
        <section>
        <p>First point, they do not know specifically what they want and where they want to apply the skills! </p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
        <h3>The 1st Problem: Not having a specific vision!</h3>
        
        <blockquote>As Seneca wrote, “If a man knows not to which port he sails, no wind is favorable.”</blockquote>
        <p>So the question is, why do you want to study a skill and where you specifically will apply that skill!</p>
        
        <p>For instance, if you want to study english only for selling cars and you won’t need it in any place else. Then we can find the method for you to learn that much maximum in one week. How I used the Uzbek language. </p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
        
        <h3>The second Problem: Too many grammars and rules (Too much focus on those)</h3>
        
        
        <p>This issue is related to the way our English books are put together. I have studied a lot of English grammar books and methods. The majority of them have the same problems. And our teachers teach whatever there is in the books, or they teach the way they have been taught, thus we come to learn too many grammars  and rules which are not necessary to our needs. Why should the teachers bother, when they won’t be rewarded for their effort.</p>
        
        </section>
        
        <section>
        <h3>The third Problem:  Too many useless words. </h3>
        
        <p>This problem is also related to the prior mentioned reason. And furthermore, the impact of our way or perception of our needs.</p>  
        </section>
        
        <section>
        
        <h3>The last Problem:  People’s laziness or lack of discipline.</h3>
        
        <p>Somewhere 90% of people are lazy. They have the potential for greatness but they waste this potential because of their laziness.</p> 
        </section>
        
        <section>
            <blockquote>Know that, to reach a goal just having motivation is not enough, for where discipline takes you motivation can’t. Discipline is when you do it even if you don't want to.</blockquote>    
            
            <blockquote>Lazzy people do a little work and think they should be winning, but winners work as hard as possible and still worry if they are being lazy.</blockquote>
        
            <blockquote>Those who want, will find a way, and those who don’t want, will find excuses</blockquote>
        
            <blockquote>Success is not an accident. It’s hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice, and most of all love of what you are doing or learning to do.  Pele</blockquote>
    
            <blockquote>Everyone wants to be Cristiano Ronaldo, but I will give you the map. You think you Will be able to do it? It's very difficult, you need discipline and consistency. You are not willing to
         do something, but you have to do it. Of course, I don't like going to the gym everyday, but I have to. Cristiano Ronaldo</blockquote>
